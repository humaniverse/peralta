## Overview

peralta is an R package to *detect* if new datasets have been published to a web
page. It does this by scanning the source code for changes in `href` attributes
and comparing these with a cache.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("humaniverse/peralta")
```
