## Overview

peralta is an R package to detect if new datasets have been published to a web
page. Define a list of *suspects* (URL's) you would like to track and then 
*peralta* informs you if there have been any updates. Don't let the data get
away!

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("humaniverse/peralta")
```

## Design philosophy

Rather than create a new calss of objects (e.g., using R6/R7), peralta was
designed to take advantage of the existing R `data.frame` class. This allows the
user to interact with data created by this package using tools already in their
arsenal.
